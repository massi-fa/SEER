  "title": "UK's £5bn 'super sewer' tunnel spanning whopping 16 miles finally complete",
  "body": "The vast infrastructure project London's links the existing sewer system at 21 different points\n\nAn epic \"super sewer\" hailed as a \"historic moment in the development of London's infrastructure\" has finally been activated. The Thames Tideway Tunnel, which has been under construction for a decade, brings 21 connections between the tunnel and the capital's original Victorian sewers, boosts capacity, as is designed to protect the tidal Thames from sewage pollution. The sewer network has struggled historically to cope with the combined challenges of climate change and population growth, and has regularly been overwhelmed by rainfall which has caused it to discharge into the Thames, a 215-mile that runs through southern England. In a press release, Tideway said the fully connected £5billion super sewer is now seeing 95% of the spills being prevented. Data published on February 14 on sewage prevented from entering the river since it first started connecting the super sewer showed 5,500,000m³ has been up to that point - the equivalent of 2,200 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nWork on the super sewer began in 2016.\n\nNew connections include the starting point of the University Boat Race at Putney Embankment, Chelsea and Victoria Embankments, Blackfriars Bridge, and King Edward Memorial Park in Wapping. The 16-mile pipe connects with the existing Lee Tunnel, a Thames Water asset which runs from Abbey Mills pumping station to Beckton sewage treatment works, forming the \"London Tideway Tunnel\" (LTT) system. Work on the super sewer, which was funded by Thames Water customers, began in 2016. Thames Water CEO Chris Weston said the project will create \"lasting benefits for biodiversity, recreation and public health\". The tunnel will still need to be tested in storm conditions over the months ahead before the project is fully complete, after which Thames Water take over the operation of the system, as per BBC News.\n\nFurther testing will be neccessary before the system is fully complete.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
