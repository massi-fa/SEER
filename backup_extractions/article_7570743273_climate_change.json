  "body": "LANETT, ALABAMA / ACCESS Newswire / February 21, 2025 / A new $20 million regional initiative announced today will bring critical home repairs, energy efficiency upgrades, and community resilience projects to more than 500 households across Alabama ...\n LANETT, ALABAMA / ACCESS Newswire / February 21, 2025 / A new $20 million regional initiative announced today will bring critical home repairs, energy efficiency upgrades, and community resilience projects to more than 500 households across Alabama and West Georgia. Funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Community Change Grant, this groundbreaking investment will reduce household energy bills by hundreds of dollars a year, strengthen local infrastructure, and establish 10 community resilience centers to protect residents during extreme weather events - creating lasting economic and environmental benefits across multiple counties.\n  Building a resilient community requires collaboration and investment, and this new $20 million initiative is bringing together local officials, municipal partners, and community business owners across Georgia and Alabama to make it happen. With a focus on energy efficiency, community resilience, and empowerment, the effort will create conditions for long-term economic development in Alabama and West Georgia\n  The SOUL™ (Save On Utilities Long term) program will provide home safety and energy efficiency upgrades over the next three years, helping households lower electricity bill costs and strengthening resilience against extreme weather. SOUL helps reduce utility bills by enhancing home energy efficiency, focusing on senior citizens and hardworking families facing high energy costs.\n  Through this initiative, 500 households will benefit from such energy efficiency upgrades as improved insulation and lighting, as well as vital home repairs including heating and air conditioning system upgrades, roof repairs, and the replacement of aging appliances-all through Groundswell 's SOUL program. This funding will direct over $11 million into home improvements-reducing average annual energy burdens by 30% to 65%, improving indoor air quality, and increasing the overall health and safety of homes.\n  The grant will serve five counties in Alabama and one in West Georgia. The investment will support the development of community resilience hubs. These hubs will offer vital resources during extreme weather events while serving as long-term centers of stability and connection. Additionally, they will help local host institutions save on energy costs-an estimated $6,000 per year per building, or more than $100,000 over the hub's lifespan-allowing those savings to be reinvested into serving the community even more effectively.\n  \"This funding isn't just about improving homes, it's about building community power,\" said Michelle Moore, CEO of Groundswell. \"Groundswell's initiatives are designed to ensure that our work delivers savings while also strengthening resilience and opportunity for all. By reducing energy burdens, strengthening local infrastructure, and investing in workforce development, we're creating lasting, sustainable clean energy solutions that directly benefit families across Georgia and Alabama.\"\n  The work will also support economic development-creating new opportunities for small businesses and enhancing workforce development opportunities.\n  \"Our community is full of hardworking people who deserve homes that are safe, efficient, and affordable to keep running,\" said City of Lanett Mayor Jamie Heard. \"This grant gives us the chance to make sure folks aren't struggling to heat their homes in the winter or cool them in the summer. Investing in our residents and their homes means investing in our local workforce, and that's a win for everyone.\"\n  Contact Information Alicia B.
