  "title": "Migrants paying for NHS treatment is 'only fair' as Britons support Braverman charge hikes",
  "body": "Prime Minister tackles questions on latest immigration figures\n\nSuella Braverman's Home Office has called for the annual surcharge paid by visa and immigration applicants in the UK to access the NHS to be increased to £2,000. Plans to raise the charge from £624 to £2,000 and increase the amount migrant workers must earn from £26,200 to £38,000 to qualify for a visa are being considered as part of tougher immigration rules to help cut record migration levels. A source told Express.co.uk: \"The points-based system is far too generous. Other countries think we are too generous. \"We need to make changes to make it tougher, such as on the health surcharge and raising the salary threshold, but the Treasury is the block.\" Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is resisting attempts to tighten the system over fears it will impact economic growth. But a new Express.co.uk poll has shown widespread support for migrants paying their way.\n\nExpress.co.uk readers have backed Suella Braverman's plans\n\nIn response, Express.co.uk ran a poll from 1pm on Tuesday, July 4, to 2pm on Wednesday, July 5, asking readers: \"Should migrant workers pay £2,000 for NHS treatment?\" Overall, 6,145 readers responded, and the most common response, with 54 percent (3,344 people) was \"Yes — it's only fair they pay their way\". In the dozens of comments left below the accompanying article, many readers thought migrant workers should contribute. Username MJav wrote: \"It is only fair that they pay for services they haven't contributed to, while the rest of us have been paying for it all our working life.\" Another, username ​​tricky english remarked: \"Absolutely it is fair. No one should get something that leaves the state out of pocket when they haven't paid in.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One reader, username gay1 said: \"Absolutely they should pay, £2,000 is too cheap.\" While username macaron agreed, writing that they should pay \"much, much more\". Username oldpoacher remarked: \"They should pay more. They must pay for what they use, just like everyone else and costs have gone up.\" Others pointed out that migrant workers should take out health insurance to cover the cost. Username mreed explained: \"£2,000 isn't enough and wouldn't even cover one treatment. Any migrant coming here to work or live should have to have full private medical insurance for themselves and anyone else they bring with them.\" And username roddavidson added: \"They should pay the full cost not just £2,000. It's called health insurance.\"\n\nTrending",
