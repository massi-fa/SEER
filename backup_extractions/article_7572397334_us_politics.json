  "title": "Elon Musk reveals the dire consequence if federal employees don't respond to email asking 'what they got done'",
  "body": "Elon Musk has threatened all federal employees with termination if they do not reply to his forthcoming email asking what they've done last week while on the clock.\n\n'Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' he wrote on X.\n\n'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,' the Space X founder added.\n\nIt is unclear if this threat could be upheld legally or if it violates US labor laws.\n\nMany federal employees are also unionized, which typically provides extra security measures when it comes to termination by forcing the employer to have 'just cause.'\n\nIn addition, many unions have already begun to sue the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Trump Administration for bulldozing through departments and affecting many federal employees' jobs.\n\nSo even if Musk follows through with his threat, it is likely a union would fight back on the dismissals.\n\nWhen Trump and Musk attempted to put 2,200 USAID workers on paid leave, two unions sued and won a temporary restraining order - which has since been reversed.\n\nElon Musk has threatened all federal employees with termination if they do not reply to his email asking what they've done last week while on the clock\n\n'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,' he wrote on X. It is unclear if this threat could be upheld legally or if it violates US labor laws\n\nJudge Carl J. Nichols, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, issued a temporary restraining order on February 7 that blocked the president from placing 2,200 USAID workers on paid leave.\n\nTwo unions associated with the agency had filed a last-minute lawsuit in an attempt to save it after Trump argued that the overseas aid agency is not a valuable use of taxpayer money and wanted to dismantle it.\n\nThey argue that the government was violating the US Constitution and that USAID workers were suffering harm, but Nichols wrote in a decision on Friday that they hadn't proved USAID workers would be irreparably harmed.\n\nHowever, Nichols also noted that that could change in the future as Trump and Musk's doings play out.\n\nAs the purge of many federal jobs continues, Musk said he would look into James Fishback's X proposal of a 'DOGE dividend,' which would give each US household a $5,000 stimulus check out of the money saved through the billionaire's department.\n\nMusk replied that he was 'curious', but said that he 'will check with the President.'\n\nFishback double-downed on his proposal on CNN, where he got into a heated exchange with host Michael Smerconish.\n\nMusk's comments regarding termination came after his alleged baby mama filed a paternity and custody lawsuit.\n\nMany federal employees are also unionized, which typically provides extra security measures when it comes to termination by forcing the employer to have 'just cause' (pictured: federal employees protesting in DC)\n\nElon Musk's 'baby mama' Ashley St. Clair, 26, shared a rare delivery room photo of her and her newborn son\n\nAlso included in the court documents, which was filed in the Supreme Court of New York on Friday, was a photo of Musk holding his newborn child\n\nAshley St. Clair, 26, filed a petition in New York on Friday asking for total custody of her son, who goes by R.S.C. in the court docs, and for Musk, 53, to take a paternity test.\n\nAs part of the exhibits for the paternity petition, the conservative firebrand shared a picture of Musk holding her son, who was born in September of last year.\n\nAlleged text messages from after the child's birth were also added in the suit, which includes one from the day the boy was born.\n\nSt. Clair had sent Musk a picture of her clutching the newborn in the delivery room.",
