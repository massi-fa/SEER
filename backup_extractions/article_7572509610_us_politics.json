He said 61% of respondents said Trump's vice president, JD Vance, should be the 2028 Republican nominee. McLaughlin did not mention Trump with regard to 2028.\n\nThe Constitution's 22nd Amendment says \"no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\"\n\nAt a Black History Month event on Thursday, Trump joked to the audience: \"Should I run again? You tell me.\"\n\nIn his first month in office, Trump has triggered a variety of controversies. He rattled Washington by putting billionaire adviser Elon Musk in charge of an effort to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy with cuts to staffing at many federal agencies.\n\n\"Elon is doing a great job,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"We love Elon, don't we?\"\n\nMusk on Saturday told federal employees to explain what they had accomplished in the last week or face termination.\n\nMusk got a hero's welcome on Thursday at CPAC when he was handed a chainsaw onstage by Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei.\n\n\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk said, waving the tool in the air.\n\nIn a social media post earlier on Saturday, Trump said Musk could do more to cut government waste.\n\n\"Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive. Remember, we have a country to save,\" he said.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs broadly on many allies and has angered Europeans by insisting they pay more for the common NATO defense and by putting pressure on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to reach a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine war.\n\nTrump said on Saturday the United States is close to an agreement with Ukraine on sharing revenue from Ukrainian minerals. His spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters at the White House that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be working around the clock over the weekend on a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war.
