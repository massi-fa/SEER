  "title": "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband recruits Extinction Rebellion cheerleaders to government roles to help push through costly agenda",
  "body": "Ed Miliband has recruited three Extinction Rebellion cheerleaders to government roles to help him push through his costly green agenda.\n\nThe Energy Secretary has quietly appointed the advisers who have all publicly expressed admiration for the radical action group which has repeatedly brought chaos to Britain's streets.\n\nMr Miliband's top team includes former Extinction Rebellion (XR) lawyer Tobias Garnett who led a successful court challenge against the Metropolitan Police five years ago when it tried to ban the group from staging disruptive protests in London.\n\nAt the time, Mr Garnett said the world was in the midst of a 'mass extinction' event, adding: 'We are responsible – and there is a limited amount of time to do something about it.'\n\nMr Garnett, now a special adviser to Mr Miliband, has since removed references to his XR past from his LinkedIn page.\n\nHe is joined at the Department of Energy by special adviser Eleanor Salter, a writer and activist who previously praised XR's 'hugely successful' campaign of disruption, saying it had been 'a great accelerator for activism'.\n\nIn the past, Ms Salter has called for a crackdown on aviation, including an end to all domestic flights.\n\nShe urged the last government to ban all new road building and suggested many cars should be taken 'off the road altogether'.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband has quietly recruited three cheerleaders to his Department of Energy who will help him push through the costly green agenda\n\nPart of Mr Miliband's team is former Extinction Rebellion (XR) lawyer Tobias Garnett who led a successful court challenge against the Met Police five years ago when it tried to ban the group from staging disruptive protests in London\n\nAlso joining the team is writer and activist Eleanor Salter, who previously praised XR's 'hugely successful' campaign of disruption, saying it had been 'a great accelerator for activism'\n\nIn September, Mr Miliband also recruited academic Rachel Kyte as the UK's new special representative for climate, working jointly with the Foreign Office.\n\nMs Kyte previously sported an XR badge at a major international climate summit and praised an eco-activist who had glued herself to the pavement outside Shell's headquarters in London.\n\nShe also appeared to back XR ahead of a week of international civil disobedience, saying people should 'act now or get out of the way'.\n\nBut former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The cost of what [Ed Miliband] is proposing is already astronomic.\n\nThe fact he has surrounded himself with some of the most extreme advocates of Net Zero is alarming and it is the public that will pay the price.\n\n'I also find it extraordinary that the Government should appoint people whose view of the way to get things done is to endorse the tactics of anarchy.'\n\nMr Miliband also recruited academic Rachel Kyte as the UK's new special representative for climate, who previously sported an XR badge at a major international climate summit\n\nMr Miliband's bid to make Britain a 'clean energy superpower' by 2030 is at the centre of the Government's agenda and seen as central to the goal of decarbonising all sectors of the economy by 2050.\n\nThe Climate Change Committee estimates that hitting the goal will cost the UK one to two per cent of GDP per year. By 2050, the annual cost could be £50billion.\n\nBut it can be revealed that one of Mr Miliband's junior ministers has previously predicted the bill could be twice as high.\n\nIn 2019, Miatta Fahnbulleh, then chief executive at the New Economics Foundation, said meeting the 2050 target would require 'a huge level of government investment'.\n\n'We think it needs to be much higher, probably three to four per cent of GDP,' she said.",
