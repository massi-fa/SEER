  "title": "Trump says Starmer and Macron 'haven't done anything' to end Ukraine war 8 minutes ago Max Matza BBC News Watch: Zelensky will sign rare mineral deal soon, says US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz",
  "body": "Zelensky has held phone calls with various global leaders in recent days, who have expressed their commitment to ensuring Ukraine is involved in peace talks.\n\nEarlier this week, Starmer said he is \"ready and willing\" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal.\n\nWhile European leaders have ruled out negotiating with Russia, they have met regularly to discuss the war in Ukraine - including at an emergency summit in Paris on Monday.\n\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 20,000 sanctions on Russia.\n\nMany European nations have also signed agreements to support and provide aid to Ukraine. In January, Starmer signed a \"landmark\" 100-year pact, telling Zelensky: \"We are with you not just today, for this year or the next - but for 100 years - long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again.\"\n\nTrump, in his Fox interview on Friday, said Russia and Ukraine would not want to begin peace talks without his own personal involvement.\n\nHe also continued to criticise Zelensky, saying: \"I've been watching this man for years now as his cities get demolished, as his people get killed, as his soldiers get decimated.\n\n\"I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards, and you get sick of it,\" he continued. \"You just get sick of it, and I've had it.\"\n\nDespite his criticism of Macron and Starmer, Trump also praised the European leaders. He said he considers Macron to be a \"friend\", and called Starmer \"a very nice guy\".\n\nMacron is expected to visit Washington DC on Monday, while Starmer is expected to arrive on Friday.\n\nAnd after criticising Zelensky over the past week - using talking points that analysts say sound more like they originate in Moscow than Washington DC - Trump offered that \"of course\" he would take a phone call from Ukraine's president.\n\nHe insisted several times that Zelensky is to blame to failing to prevent war, saying that Russia could have been \"talked out\" of invading Ukraine.\n\nAsked about Ukraine's absence at peace talks in Saudi Arabia this week, Trump said that Russia \"found it impossible to make a deal with Zelensky\".\n\nHe said he believes that Russia sincerely wants a deal to end the war, but that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"doesn't have to make a deal\".\n\nUS Vice-President JD Vance later hit back at critics who said that Trump's stance on Russia amounts to \"appeasement\".",
