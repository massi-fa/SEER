  "title": "Cabinet member Kelly Loeffler gives hilarious tour of empty office to make point about controversial order",
  "body": "Newly confirmed Small Business Administration (SBA) head Kelly Loeffler has shared a video tour of her agency's headquarters, highlighting vacant offices amid a push to end remote work for federal employees.\n\n'It's my second day here at the SBA,' Loeffler said on Friday. 'I could not be more excited to be here. So I thought I'd take a walk.\n\n'And what I found is that exactly what's been said is true. About 90 percent of our employees are working from home. Well, that ends Monday with President Trump's return to work,' she added.\n\nThe video has since amassed more than 21 million views on X.\n\nFederal employees who have worked remotely, either fully or partially, for nearly five years must now return to the office following an executive order from Trump requiring all federal workers to resume in-person work.\n\nFormer Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior Department Jeremy Carl argued on X that the inability to fire federal employees leads to a lack of accountability.\n\n'The problem with work from home in the federal government is that the employees cannot be fired,' he wrote. 'When you don't have to show up to the office, and there is no accountability for your performance [and] that is a recipe for disaster.'\n\nElon Musk, billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), also weighed in, posting simply, 'No one at work.'\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with Loeffler's stance.\n\nNewly confirmed Small Business Administration (SBA) head Kelly Loeffler shared a video tour of her agency's headquarters on Friday, highlighting vacant offices as she reinforced the administration's push to end remote work for federal employees\n\nFederal employees who have worked remotely, either fully or partially, for nearly five years must now return to the office following an executive order from Trump requiring all federal workers to resume in-person work\n\nMarket researcher Anna Matson pushed back, defending remote work as beneficial for families.\n\n'This is one of the worst Trump policies,' she wrote on Friday.\n\n'There used to be one parent at home and one that worked. Now, both parents must work to survive.\n\n'Adding 2-3 hours a day to their workday significantly reduces time with their family. If we want to support families, work from home when feasible should remain.'\n\nMeanwhile, Congressional Republicans have called on Loeffler to provide answers regarding the SBA's failure to aggressively recover fraudulent or misallocated COVID relief funds.\n\nLoeffler, 54, was the latest to be confirmed to lead the Small Business Administration on Wednesday, following Howard Lutnick who will lead the Commerce Department.\n\n'A huge honor to be at the Capitol today as my former Senate colleagues voted to confirm me as the 28th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration,' said Loeffler in a post on X.\n\n'Profoundly grateful to @POTUS for the trust he's placed in me to help advance his America First agenda - and unleash a new era of growth, innovation, and prosperity for small business and all Americans.'\n\nLoeffler, 54, was the latest to be confirmed to lead the Small Business Administration on Wednesday, following Howard Lutnick who will lead the Commerce Department\n\nLoeffler previously co-chaired Trump's Inaugural Committee alongside Steve Witkoff, the former president's special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nBefore entering politics, she served as CEO of a financial services firm and later represented Georgia in Congress from 2020 to 2021.\n\nHer husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.",
