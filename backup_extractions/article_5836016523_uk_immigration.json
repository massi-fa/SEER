  "body": "Age tests for migrants who claim to be children will start this year\n\nMigrants will soon be subject to age tests, the Government has announced, after a 41-year-old man posed as a child to claim asylum in the UK. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick has told MPs that officials will carry out medical assessments when people arrive in the country. X-Rays and MRI scans are reportedly among the methods being considered to foil false age claims, which would land people preferential treatment in the eyes of the law. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Jenrick said the new measures would be introduced \"over the course of this year\" as he condemned people who \"abuse the system\". He also addressed the recent case of a man who was nearly 30 years older than he claimed.\n\nThe minister said that immigration officials recently discovered a man who claimed to be a child was, in fact, 41. The man was the \"oldest individual we've encountered\" posing as a youngster after arriving in the country, he added. Lone children arriving in the UK to claim asylum receive immediate access to assistance, support and protection from authorities, and they are taken to specialised centres. Asylum-seeking adults, on the other hand, often spend months being processed as they wait for their asylum applications to be approved.\n\nREAD MORE: Thousands of migrants to avoid deportation to Rwanda after major climbdown\n\nRobert Jenrick said the Home Office is working on new age assessments\n\nThe difference in treatment can lead to cases of migrant adults attempting to pass as children, as Mr Jenrick said, with age assessments often deemed imprecise. At present, methods include skeletal and teeth examination and assessment of physical appearance. In the coming year, the Home Office may complement these with X-rays of wisdom teeth, hands and wrists, and MRI scans of knees and collar bones. But in January 2023, the Government's own scientific advisory committee warned these plans would put children at risk of radiation, cause distress and that they would not clarify age \"with precision\".\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: \"It's important that we weed out those cases of abuse because it poses such a risk.\" He briefly touched on a case in which a man posing as a child murdered an aspiring Royal Marine. He said: \"I'm afraid we've seen some very tragic instances such as the murder that occurred in Bournemouth at the behest of somebody who had posed as a child.\"\n\nTrending",
