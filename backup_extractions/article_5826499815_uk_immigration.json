If there are children arriving in the United Kingdom via small boats, then as soon as they land in the UK they are looked after properly Treasury minister Victoria Atkins\n\nThe number of people who made the crossing last year reached a record 45,755, prompting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to make \"stopping the boats\" a key priority.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has been battling to get her central policy of forcibly removing unauthorised arrivals to Rwanda off the ground after it was blocked by appeal judges.\n\nThe Government has lodged a bid to take its legal battle to the Supreme Court.\n\nTreasury minister Victoria Atkins insisted the Government was focused on the \"fundamentals\" of looking after children, after being repeatedly asked whether reports that immigration minister Robert Jenrick had cartoon murals at an asylum centre painted over made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nIt must be terrifying for children who come across and so that is why we are so focused on stopping the boats. Treasury minister Victoria Atkins\n\nMs Atkins told the Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme on Sky News: \"I think we have got to focus on the fundamentals here. If there are children arriving in the United Kingdom via small boats, then as soon as they land in the UK they are looked after properly.\n\n\"The local authorities step in, they have their welfare, their health needs and their schooling needs looked after. That is the fundamentals.\n\n\"But we also have to stop people from being enticed by criminal gangs to cross the Channel, because that journey in itself is such a dangerous journey.\n\n\"It must be terrifying for children who come across and so that is why we are so focused on stopping the boats.\"",
