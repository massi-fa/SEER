  "body": "More than 1,000 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in two days, taking the provisional total for the year so far to over 12,500.\n\nA total of 384 people were detected on Saturday and 686 on Friday – the new highest daily total this year, according to Home Office figures.\n\nIt means 1,070 migrants crossed the Channel over two days, in 13 boats on Friday and in seven boats on Saturday, taking the provisional total for the year so far to 12,503.\n\nI think we have got to focus on the fundamentals here. If there are children arriving in the United Kingdom via small boats, then as soon as they land in the UK they are looked after properly Treasury minister Victoria Atkins\n\nThe number of people who made the crossing last year reached a record 45,755, prompting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to make \"stopping the boats\" a key priority.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has been battling to get her central policy of forcibly removing unauthorised arrivals to Rwanda off the ground after it was blocked by appeal judges.\n\nThe Government has lodged a bid to take its legal battle to the Supreme Court.\n\nA total of 384 people were detected crossing the Channel on Saturday and 686 on Friday (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\nTreasury minister Victoria Atkins insisted the Government was focused on the \"fundamentals\" of looking after children, after being repeatedly asked whether reports that immigration minister Robert Jenrick had cartoon murals at an asylum centre painted over made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nIt must be terrifying for children who come across and so that is why we are so focused on stopping the boats. Treasury minister Victoria Atkins\n\nMs Atkins told the Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme on Sky News: \"I think we have got to focus on the fundamentals here. If there are children arriving in the United Kingdom via small boats, then as soon as they land in the UK they are looked after properly.\n\n\"The local authorities step in, they have their welfare, their health needs and their schooling needs looked after. That is the fundamentals.\n\n\"But we also have to stop people from being enticed by criminal gangs to cross the Channel, because that journey in itself is such a dangerous journey.\n\n\"It must be terrifying for children who come across and so that is why we are so focused on stopping the boats.\"",
