  "body": "DON THE ATTACK Trump demands 'ANYTHING we can get' from Ukraine as he pledges to see 'if gold is still in Fort Knox' with Elon Musk\n\nDONALD Trump has demanded \"anything we can get\" from Ukraine in a marquee speech to his adoring fans.\n\nThe Republican also pledged to find out whether tonnes of gold bars are still inside Fort Knox with his pal Elon Musk.\n\n3 United States President Donald Trump arrived at CPAC in National Harbor, Maryland on Saturday Credit: Reuters\n\n3 Trump walked towards the podium to repeated chants of 'USA' Credit: AFP\n\n3 Zelensky is reportedly not ready to sign the 'problematic' minerals deal with the US Credit: AFP\n\nTrump made the remarks demanding oil and rare earth minerals at a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday as his row with President Volodymyr Zelensky rumbles on.\n\nHe said: \"I'm dealing with President Zelensky. I'm dealing with President Putin and I'm trying to get the money back or secured.\"\n\nThe President said that the US has given $350 billion in aid to the war-torn nation while Europe has given $100 billion.\n\nHe said: \"Europe gave it in the form of a loan, they get their money back.\n\n\"We gave it in the form of nothing so I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up.\n\n\"We're asking for rare earth, oil, anything we can get.\"\n\nThe president then slammed his predecessor Joe Biden for failing to \"get equalisation\" with Europe regarding aid as he said the war \"does not affect us\" like it does the continent.\n\n\"How come we went so far out front and he didn't know that Europe gets its money back? It's not fair.\"\n\nBut the President says he believes he is \"pretty close to a deal\" despite a source telling Sky News that Zelensky is not ready to sign a \"problematic\" minerals deal with the US.\n\nThe deal proposed by Trump's team would see Kyiv hand over billions of dollars of minerals to Washington DC in exchange for weapons.\n\nZelensky 'refuses to sign Trump deal' on Ukraine war after White House insiders rage he'd be 'six feet under' without US\n\nThe Ukrainian source said: \"The agreement is not yet ready to be signed, there are a number of problematic issues, and in the current form of the draft, the president is not ready to accept it.\n\n\"Today, the drafts do not reflect a partnership in the agreement and contain only unilateral commitments by Ukraine.\"\n\nAs the split between the US and Ukraine continues to widen after Trump branded Zelensky a \"dictator\", Kyiv has held \"productive\" talks with Trump's war hero envoy General Keith Kellogg about the deal.\n\nKellogg has been striking a tone which has broken by the furious stance of the Trump White House.",
