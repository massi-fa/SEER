  "body": "It's been a little more than five years since Amy Blain and her family woke at 7am during summer holidays on the NSW south coast to find it still pitch black.\n\nSmoke was blocking out the morning light as a bushfire approached.\n\nThe Blains were hopeful when the sky started to brighten until they realised it was turning a reddish hue as the blaze drew closer.\n\nAmy and her partner spent a few frantic hours working out what was going on, particularly fearful for the health of their three-month-old baby in the thick smoke.\n\nTheir eldest daughter, then six, was asking repeatedly \"Are we going to be okay?\" but they didn't know how to answer.\n\n\"As a parent, I just felt totally powerless and unable to give the reassurance we both needed,\" Ms Blain told AAP.\n\nWithin a few hours, evacuations began to a nearby beach.\n\nMs Blain recalled bits of debris swirling in the air and a glowing red outline on the ridge line.\n\n\"Then the wind changed and you could just hear the collective sigh of relief ... that was a sign everything was going to be okay,\" she said.\n\nHer family were among many forced to flee the devastating Black Summer bushfires that started in 2019 and continued into 2020, taking 33 lives, destroying 3000 homes and decimating wildlife populations as blazes razed 17 million hectares in total.\n\nTo mark the anniversary, the Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action group will launch a declaration calling for Australian governments to recommit to the climate fight.\n\nSurvivors will ask big polluters to pay for the costs of climate-fuelled fires and seek renewed commitment to the renewable energy rollout at a Sydney event.\n\nPoliticians from fire-hit areas have been invited to attend.\n\nMs Blain was cognisant her experience of the fires was not as extreme as other survivors but said it still had a lasting impact.\n\nWhile her youngest was only a baby at the time, Ms Blain said she remains sensitive to sirens.\n\nHer eldest daughter, now 11, is hyper-aware of colour changes in the sky.\n\nMs Blain was already involved in Parents for Climate but has since volunteered with other community-oriented groups in her home city of Canberra, including Peoples Climate Assembly, Electrify Canberra and local environmental restoration efforts.\n\n\"As a parent, I've got a duty to show them that I'm doing absolutely everything I can to make sure they don't have to live through that again,\" she said.\n\nDr Brenda Dobia, a member for Psychologists for a Safe Climate, said a focus on community building and local connection was key to helping people recover emotionally after fires, floods and other extreme weather events.\n\n\"It does come back to how well organised you are locally to be able to support each other, both in managing the immediate thing but then also in the aftermath,\" she told AAP.\n\nThe experienced phycologist believes climate change poses challenges for treating post-traumatic stress disorder after fires, floods and the like.\n\nTypically associated with ongoing fear and anxiety after a traumatic event, she said recovery from PTSD tends to happen gradually as feelings of safety return.\n\nBut with disasters only expected to become more severe and frequent as greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase temperatures, restoring a sense of safety has become more difficult.\n\nHelping people foster stronger connections with others in the community is key to recovery and resilience, she said, especially in political climates that are not as reassuring as they could be.\n\nLifeline 13 11 14\n\nbeyondblue 1300 22 4636",
