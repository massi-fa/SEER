  "title": "Who is Kash Patel's girlfriend? Trump's FBI director is dating a country music star turned conservative icon",
  "body": "As FBI Director Kash Patel faced his confirmation hearing, he had the support of a striking mystery woman — now identified as his girlfriend, country singer and Republican press secretary Alexis Wilkins.\n\nWilkins, whose presence drew public curiosity, later stood by Patel's side at his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nDressed elegantly in an all-white gown, she impressed attendees with her grace and warmth.\n\nPatel, meanwhile, used his speech to reflect on his journey as a first-generation Indian American achieving the American Dream.\n\nAddressing the media, he remarked, 'You have written everything you possibly can about me that is fake, malicious, slanderous and defamatory. Keep it coming, bring it on and leave the men and women in the FBI out of it.'\n\nWilkins, 26, spoke fondly of Patel, 44, highlighting his loyalty and kindness.\n\n\"Everything else — political — aside, this man is the most loyal, the most kind, the most caring person... I'm gonna cry,\" she said to the media before Patel kissed her forehead.\n\nShe recalled a conversation with former President Trump, who asked, 'Kash is loyal, right?' — to which she confidently responded, 'Yes.'\n\nThe couple first met at a ReAwaken America event in October 2022 and began dating in January 2023.\n\nAs Kash Patel, President Donald Trump 's nominee for FBI Director, faced his confirmation hearing, he had the support of a striking mystery woman—now identified as his girlfriend, country singer and Republican press secretary Alexis Wilkins\n\nWhile Wilkins has taken a role as press secretary for Rep. Abe Hamadeh (R-Ariz.), she plans to split her time between D.C. and Nashville, keeping her place in the heart of the country music scene\n\nTheir relationship, now over two years strong, has sparked intrigue among MAGA supporters, with online searches about Patel's relationship status surging during his confirmation hearing.\n\nNow, the pair is preparing to move to Washington, D.C., together, DailyMail.com exclusively revealed.\n\nHowever, Wilkins isn't leaving her country music career behind.\n\nWhile she has taken a role as press secretary for Rep. Abe Hamadeh (R-Ariz.), she plans to split her time between D.C. and Nashville, keeping her place in the heart of the country music scene.\n\nRaised primarily in Arkansas, Wilkins also spent parts of her childhood in England and Switzerland.\n\nA Nashville-based independent artist, she has shared the stage with country legends like Lee Greenwood, Sara Evans, Joe Nichols, Aaron Lewis, Curtis Grimes and RaeLynn.\n\nHer Veteran's Day single Stand and debut EP Grit both landed in the iTunes Top 10. Passionate about veterans' causes, she works with Warrior Rounds, a group that collaborates with veterans to create music, and frequently performs at VA hospitals.\n\nBeyond music, Wilkins has become a rising conservative voice.\n\nShe has spoken at Young America's Foundation (YAF) events, appeared at the Reagan Ranch, and collaborated with the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.\n\nThe couple first met at a ReAwaken America event in October 2022 and began dating in January 2023\n\nShe's also a speaker and media personality for PragerU, hosts the Between the Headlines podcast on Rumble, and is involved with the NRA Country program, which connects country artists with Second Amendment supporters.\n\nWith her expanding influence in both politics and entertainment, Wilkins is set to make waves in D.C. — and she and Patel seem more committed than ever to their future together.",
