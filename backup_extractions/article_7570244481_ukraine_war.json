  "body": "MARCHING DON Trump 'will join Putin in Moscow at massive WW2 military parade' as Vlad plans to 'celebrate victory' over Ukraine\n\nPRESIDENT Donald Trump is to join pal Vladimir Putin in Moscow for World War II commemorations.\n\nIt comes after the Republican slammed Ukrainian President Zelensky's approval ratings, called for fresh Ukraine elections and appeared to suggest that Ukraine started the war with Russia following the historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\n3 Donald Trump (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive for a meeting in Helsinki in 2018 Credit: AFP\n\n3 President Donald Trump speaks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Tuesday\n\n3 Putin speaks during while visiting the Radar MMC military plant today\n\nThe Republican will fly to Russia for Victory Day celebrations on May 9, according to French news magazine Le Point, citing Russian sources.\n\nMay 9 parades are held throughout Russia as a celebration of its defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 that Putin has turned into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nVictory Day is a means to showcase to the world the might of the Russian military machine, recall wartime sacrifice and garner national pride - all led by a showcase event in Moscow's Red Square.\n\nPutin praised his Republican pal for \"changing his position\" when he \"began to receive objective information\" on Wednesday - a mere few hours after Zelensky slammed Trump for living in a \"Russian disinformation bubble\".\n\nThe tyrant said he welcomed Tuesday's talks between Russian and US officials in Saudi Arabia, dubbing them the \"first step\" to restore relations with Washington.\n\nSpeaking from a drone factory in Saint Petersburg, smug Vlad said: \"I was briefed [on the talks]. I rate them highly, there is a result.\n\n\"In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests.\"\n\nHe added that ensuring there's a resolution to the conflict is a top priority for Russia, but explained that his country has to build trust with the US to achieve this.\n\nIn Kyiv, Deputy Minister of Defence Serhii Boiev hit back at Donald Trump's claim that European troops in Kyiv will spark World War Three.\n\nHe warned that without the presence of British or European allies, Putin will pretend to agree to a ceasefire while secretly \"firing on all cylinders in recruiting and training\".\n\nThe silver-haired top minister added that without a fresh pledge of military support from Trump, in three months time the army will experience a critical dip in weapons supplies.\n\nIn a secret briefing room, Mr Boiev told The Sun that Sir Keir Starmer was completely right to pledge \"British boots on the ground\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister made a rallying cry to Europe urging leaders to \"step up\" and deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe PM vowed the UK will \"do our bit\" to try and enforce a peace deal.\n\nMr Boiev said: \"If Ukraine doesn't go to Nato then Nato needs to go to Ukraine.\n\n\"We want European forces to be here to ensure a sustainable peace.\n\n\"The security guarantees that come out of this war are essential including the contingency of allies on the ground.\"\n\nLabour MPs David Taylor and Phill Brickell, who met with Mr Boiev in Kyiv, said: \"If the US falter, the UK must be willing to step up. The front line here in Ukraine is the front line for Brits. The evil tyrant Putin will not stop.\n\n\"Keir Starmer must set a rapid path to at least 2.5% on defence. We must look to support a new, protected supply chain of easy to make and easy to use warfare drones.\n\n\"And, we must designate all members of the United Russia Party as terrorists, using any sanctioned money for the war effort.\"\n\nThe dictator also shared that Trump was starting to receive \"objective information\", without elaborating.\n\nHe added: \"We will be ready to return to the negotiating table\".\n\nZelensky accused Moscow of misleading Trump in a press conference earlier - which the US President has since responded to in a tirade on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said this afternoon: \"Unfortunately, President Trump, who we have great respect for as leader of the American people ... lives in this disinformation space.\"\n\nSpeaking right after the US and Russian foreign ministers held talks in Saudi Arabia, Zelensky continued: \"We want security guarantees this year because we want to end the war this year.\"",
