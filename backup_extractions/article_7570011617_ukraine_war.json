The two leaders had previously met on the sidelines of various global platforms.\n\nLamola openly defended Ukraine's right to have a seat at the table in any peace talks on ending the war.\n\n\"We still think that any peace negotiation process should be inclusive and that inclusiveness should then include Ukraine very clearly. And that's the approach that we will continue to take,\" he said.\n\nThere were vastly different claims — Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in his speech Thursday that Western countries were to blame for the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe top U.K. diplomat, David Lammy, said Russia apparently is not seeking peace.\n\n\"I have to say when I listened to what the Russians and what Lavrov have just said ... I don't see an appetite to really get to that peace,\" Lammy said.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said that if Ukraine were to capitulate, that \"would set a terrible example for every country in the world that would then be under the threat of predation by its bigger neighbor.\"\n\nThe U.N.'s economic commission for Africa representative Claver Gatete said global conflicts have implications for African countries, citing the continent's rise in inflation and food prices since Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where the conflict is, it has an impact on Africa,\" Gatete said.\n\nSouth Africa will host the G20 Leaders' Summit in November this year, a gathering that's expected to be attended by G20 heads of state.",
