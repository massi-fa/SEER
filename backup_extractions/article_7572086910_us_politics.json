  "body": "A woman wears a 'MAGA' jacket displaying her support for President Donald Trump at a major convention of conservatives in National Harbor, Maryland on February 21, 2025\n\nSporting a \"Trump Was Right\" T-shirt and a \"Make America Great Again\" cap, Carol Newton was brimming with impatience to see the US president before he addressed a conservative convention near Washington.\n\nA month after his return to the White House, Donald Trump has been a \"whirlwind,\" said the 63-year-old retiree.\n\nAnd after four years under President Joe Biden, she added, \"That's what we needed.\"\n\nHailing from northwestern Washington state, Newton said she had seen the Republican billionaire \"a half-dozen times.\"\n\nAnd every time, she added, \"You come away feeling good and, you know, enlightened and hopeful and enriched.\"\n\nNewton had brought her young grandson to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a yearly assembly of top Republicans in suburban Maryland.\n\nShe didn't expect anything terribly new from Trump's speech on Saturday, saying she's happy to hear \"the same message.\"\n\n- 'Golden Era' -\n\nIn the corridors of the sprawling National Harbor convention center, Trump's image and name are omnipresent.\n\nAttendees can take selfies with a life-sized cardboard likeness, purchase sequined vests bearing the words \"Trump: The Golden Era\" or wear T-shirts showing Trump defiant with a bloodied ear after last July's assassination attempt.\n\nOne woman sported a \"Daddy's Home\" T-shirt bearing a picture of the Republican leader outside the White House, while another proudly displays red, white and blue fingernails with \"TRUMP\" spelled out on one hand and \"VANCE,\" the US vice president, on the other.\n\nMerchandise in support of US President Donald Trump at a vendor booth during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)\n\n\"People are happy that Trump is president, you know, and last year we were all hoping he would be,\" said Clark Page, a 70-year-old retiree from Alabama, referring to the previous CPAC confab.\n\nThis is Page's sixth CPAC. He said he first saw Trump in 2015 at a rally in his home state.\n\n\"The first time I saw him, I thought, 'Oh, he's going to be president.'\"\n\n- 'Not as crowded' -\n\nPage, a former medical equipment salesman, said Trump's first month back in office had been \"fantastic.\"\n\n\"Reagan was fantastic, too,\" he added, referring to the conservative president from the 1980s, \"but I've never seen a president as effective as Donald Trump.\"\n\nCutouts of Donald Trump and White House 'border czar' Tom Homan with photos of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris behind bars at a \"Deportation Center\" booth at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)\n\nWhile the CPAC attendees interviewed expressed universal excitement about Trump, some said this year's convention was a bit disappointing.\n\n\"It's not as crowded as it has been,\" said 39-year-old Rex Clark, who works for a military contractor. \"I hope everybody's not being complacent.\"\n\nJames Ong, a student at Catholic University in Washington, agreed.\n\n\"There's like, less enthusiasm here compared to past CPACs,\" said Ong, who campaigned for Trump last year and is attending his third meeting of the group.\n\nThe young people he saw at previous CPAC conventions, the 21-year-old Ong added, seem to have given way to \"Baby Boomers\" and older Americans.",
