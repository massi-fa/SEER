  "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is expected to confirm a timeline to raise defence spending and give Donald Trump an invitation for a state visit when he visits Washington next week, according to a report.\n\nThe Prime Minister will have to walk a tricky line when he meets Mr Trump, balancing the UK's support for Ukraine with the need to keep the US onside.\n\nThe US president has started negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict, but excluded Kyiv from the talks – and a deepening rift has emerged between him and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as the two have traded barbs.\n\nWashington has also put pressure on the UK and its allies to do more to shoulder the burden of European defence.\n\nThe late Queen and Donald Trump Credit: Chris Jackson/PA\n\nIn an effort to ease tensions, Sir Keir is expected during the trip to finally set a date, likely 2030, for the UK to reach its goal of spending 2.5% of GDP, The Telegraph reported. This is up from the current 2.3%.\n\nThe Prime Minister will also deliver an invitation from the King for a state visit to the UK, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe US president is known to admire the royal family.\n\nSir Keir's trip to Washington will come after Ukraine marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. A defence announcement is expected to mark the occasion.\n\nIt will also come after a visit to Washington by Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMr Trump said Sir Keir and the French president \"haven't done anything\" to end the war in Ukraine in the last three years.\n\n\"They didn't do anything either (to end the war). The war's going on, no meetings with Russia, no nothing.\n\n\"They haven't done anything. Macron is a friend of mine, and I've met with the Prime Minister and he's a very nice guy (but) nobody's done anything,\" he told a Fox News podcast released Friday.\n\nMr Macron has said he intends to tell his American counterpart not to \"be weak\" in the face of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nSir Keir is also facing pressure to take a firm line when he meets Mr Trump.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Trump of plotting a \"stitch-up\" with Mr Putin that \"amounts to a betrayal of Ukraine\", and urged the Prime Minister to speak \"honestly and openly\" with him.\n\nSir Ed added: \"I think we're all astonished and deeply alarmed, and if the British Prime Minister doesn't reflect that, he's not reflecting the views of the British people.\"\n\nBut senior Cabinet minister Pat McFadden stressed the importance of maintaining a \"good and constructive relationship\" with the White House.\n\n\"I think the UK is potentially in a good position with this administration, if we handle it correctly.\n\nPat McFadden said the Government should not follow 'every twist and turn of every comment' made by Donald Trump Credit: Victoria Jones/PA\n\n\"Handling it correctly doesn't mean following every twist and turn of every comment, but is focusing on what will actually happen as well as what was said,\" he said at a fringe event at the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow on Friday.\n\nThe growing rift between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky presents a challenge for the Prime Minister.\n\nThe US leader described Mr Zelensky as a \"dictator\".\n\nThe Ukrainian president then claimed Mr Trump was living in a Russian \"disinformation space\", which led White House officials to accuse Mr Zelensky of \"insulting\" his counterpart.\n\nThe Americans also cancelled a planned joint press conference in Kyiv, in a sign of a deepening feud between the two countries.\n\nBusinessman Elon Musk, who is acting as an adviser on federal spending to Mr Trump, meanwhile suggested Mr Zelensky is running a \"fraud machine feeding off the dead bodies of soldiers\", suggesting limited appetite for continued American support for Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump's Ukraine envoy, retired general Keith Kellogg, praised Mr Zelensky on Friday as an \"embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war\" following what he described as \"extensive and positive discussions\" between the two men.\n\nMr Macron said he would tell Mr Trump: \"It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest.\n\n\"How can you then be credible in the face of China if you're weak in the face of Putin?\"\n\nPoland's president Andrzej Duda is set to meet Mr Trump on Saturday, Polish news agency PAP reported.\n\nMr Duda said he had a \"candid\" conversation with Mr Zelensky on Friday and urged him to \"remain committed to the course of calm and constructive co-operation\" with Mr Trump.\n\n\"I trust that good will and honesty form the foundation of the US negotiation strategy,\" he posted on X.",
