  "body": "T he UK and Turkey have struck a new deal to address the surge in illegal migration, which will focus on co-ordinated actions to \"disrupt and dismantle people smuggling gangs\".\n\nPart of the deal is the establishment of a new operational \"centre of excellence\" by the Turkish National Police.\n\nSupported by the UK, the centre will focus on addressing organised immigration crime by sharing intelligence more fully and more quickly between the two nations.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman (Jordan Pettitt/PA) / PA Wire\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said: \"As I've made clear, we must do everything we can to smash the people smuggling gangs and stop the boats.\n\n\"Our partnership with Turkey, a close friend and ally, will enable our law enforcement agencies to work together on this international problem and tackle the small boat supply chain.\"\n\nImmigration minister Robert Jenrick said: \"We will be intensively sharing intelligence, people and technology to disrupt and dismantle people smuggling gangs and the manufacture and supply of materials which enable small boat crossings.\n\n\"Having met our partners in Europe, North Africa and indeed Turkey recently, I've seen first-hand the benefits our increased co-operation has on stopping the boats.\n\n\"I am determined that the UK is a leading force in tackling illegal migration and a partner to all those allies who share our determination to defeat it.\"\n\nMigrants have begun arriving on the Bibby Stockholm barge docked in Portland off the coast of Dorset (James Manning/PA) / PA Wire\n\nThe new operational centre will aim to strengthen collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Home Office Intelligence staff based in Turkey and their Turkish counterparts.\n\nThe UK will also deploy more officers in Turkey to collaborate on joint operations to disrupt criminal gangs facilitating illegal journeys.\n\nAccording to the Home Office, the export of small boats and boat parts across Europe to facilitate illegal crossings to the UK is a vital element of people smugglers' tactics with hundreds of small boats and boat parts thought to be transported each year.\n\nThe deal comes after Mr Jenrick's visit to Turkey last month, where he visited the Turkish-Bulgarian Border Check Point at Kapikule – the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe.\n\nThe announcement is also one of a series the Government will be making as part of its \"stop the boats\" week.\n\nOn Monday, after weeks of delays, the first 15 asylum seekers boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge.\n\nAround 50 people were expected to move onboard the giant vessel, docked in Portland Port in Dorset, but around 20 were granted a last-minute reprieve after legal challenges.",
