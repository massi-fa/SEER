  "title": "Enrique Tarrio follows and insults officers who defended US Capitol on January 6",
  "body": "Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group who was convicted and then pardoned for his role in the January 6 insurrection, confronted a group of police officers who defended the Capitol during the attack, accusing one of them of being a \"coward\".\n\nA video shared by Tarrio on social media on Saturday showed him following the officers, Michael Fanone, Harry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell, through the lobby of a Washington hotel that was hosting the Principles First summit, a conference where one of the officers received a \"profile in courage\" award.\n\nIn the video, an unidentified woman with the officers tells Tarrio: \"You guys are traitors, just back off.\"\n\n\"You were brave on Twitter,\" Tarrio said to one of the officers as he continued to follow them. \"You guys were brave at my sentencing when you sat there and laughed when I got 22 fucking years. Now you don't want to look in my eyes, you fucking cowards.\"\n\nFanone, a former Capitol police officer, then turns and tells him: \"You're a traitor to this country.\"\n\nIn 2023, Tarrio received a sentence of 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the January 6 attack. Donald Trump pardoned Tarrio and roughly 1,500 other insurrection participants when he took office last month, an act that prompted outcry from many lawmakers, including some Republicans.\n\nGonell, a former Capitol police sergeant who defended the Capitol on January 6, acknowledged the confrontation with Tarrio as he accepted his \"profile in courage\" award from Principles First. A spokesperson for Principles First, which is considered a center-right alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), did not immediately respond to the Guardian's request for comment on the confrontation with Tarrio.\n\n\"A few moments ago, we were upstairs, and Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys were upstairs,\" Gonell told conference attendees, prompting surprised gasps from the crowd. \"How they got into the building, I don't know, but it's insane that we had to be subjected to their harassment now because they feel emboldened and empowered because of the pardons that they received.\n\n\"We shouldn't be harassed for doing the right thing, for telling our story, for telling the truth, for speaking against them in court and in public. They're the traitor. They're the one who attacked the Capitol.\"\n\nThe confrontation at the conference came one day after Tarrio was arrested near the Capitol for simple assault after he allegedly struck the cellphone and arm of a woman who was protesting an event he was attending with other January 6 insurrectionists.\n\nAt a panel discussion held at the summit a couple of hours before the confrontation with Tarrio, four police officers who protected the Capitol on January 6 – Daniel Hodges of the Metropolitan police department and former Capitol police officers Gonell, Fanone and Dunn – expressed outrage over the pardons offered to the insurrectionists.\n\n\"He pardoned them because he wants people to know that, if you commit crimes on his behalf, he's got your back,\" Fanone said.\n\nFanone described far-right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, who played an instrumental role in executing the January 6 attack, as \"Donald Trump's personal brownshirt militia\", referring to the German Nazi party's paramilitary storm troopers of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n\"They are operating under the assumption that, if they commit violent criminal acts on Donald Trump's behalf, that he will pardon them for future violence,\" Fanone said. \"These are insurrectionists, let's be very clear.\"\n\nA member of the audience appeared to agree with Fanone's assessment, yelling in response to his comment: \"Traitors!\"\n\nFanone replied: \"Yes, fucking traitors.\"\n\nHe later urged conference attendees to forcefully push back against Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" political movement, telling them: \"That is what we are up against: the indecency, the cruelty, the inhumanity of this movement that needs to be purged – purged – from America.\"\n\nDunn, who moderated the discussion, applauded his fellow officers for keeping a spotlight on the January 6 attack, reminding the audience: \"History is going to remember us for what we did or did not do.\"",
