They consider it their North Star,\" said the source. \"Losing Starlink ... would be a massive blow.\"\n\nZelenskiy has rejected demands from President Donald Trump's administration for $500 billion in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, saying the U.S. has offered no specific security guarantees.\n\nOn Friday, the Ukrainian president said the U.S. and Ukrainian teams were working on an agreement and Trump said he expects a deal will be signed soon.\n\nMusk rushed thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine to replace communications services destroyed by Russia after its February 2022 invasion. Hailed as a hero in Ukraine, Musk later curtailed access at least once before in the fall of 2022 as he became more critical of Kyiv's handling of the war.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are divided over Trump's efforts to find a quick end to the Ukraine war and some have raised questions about Musk's rapid-fire efforts to cull thousands of federal workers and shut down Federal agencies.\n\nMelinda Haring, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, said Starlink was essential for Ukraine´s operation of drones, a key pillar of its military strategy.\n\n\"Losing Starlink would be a game changer,\" Haring said, noting that Ukraine was now at 1:1 parity with Russia in terms of drone usage and artillery shells. Ukraine has a wide range of different drone capabilities, ranging from sea drones and surveillance drones to long-range unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Washington, the White House and the U.S. Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSpaceX, which operates Starlink, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast fall, Ukraine floated the idea of opening its critical minerals to investment by allies. This was part of a \"victory plan\" that sought to put it in the strongest position for talks and force Moscow to the table.\n\nTrump has embraced the idea, saying he wants Ukraine to supply the U.S. with rare earths and other minerals in return for financially supporting its war effort.\n\nZelenskiy rejected a detailed U.S. proposal last week that would have seen Washington and U.S. firms receiving 50% of Ukraine's critical minerals, which include graphite, uranium, titanium and lithium, a key component in electric car batteries.\n\nSince then a rift has emerged between the leaders, with Trump denouncing Zelenskiy as \"a dictator without elections\" on Wednesday after Zelenskiy said Trump was trapped in a Russian disinformation bubble, a response to the U.S. president suggesting Ukraine started the war.
